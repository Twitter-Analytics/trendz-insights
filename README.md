# Trendz-Insights 
> Uncovering twitter trends through sentiment analysis

We developed a real-time sentiment analysis system for Twitter (X) trends using Kafka and Spark. This project's aim is to leverage data-driven business insights to help companies assess and forecast public sentiment on trending topics.

This project aims to bridge the gap between data and people, offering a unique window into data-driven analytics and enhancing businesses' ability to make informed decisions based on real-time public opinion.



Trendz-Insights is a project that aims to analyze trends on social media, particularly Twitter, using a pipeline of technologies including Kafka, Spark Streaming, PostgreSQL, Power BI, and Spring Boot. The project utilizes external NLTK for NLP based sentiment analysis of tweets and trends, and TF-IDF for trend generation.
